# Accessible Telecoms Demo

todo: project description...

## Use

The simplest way to run this demo application is directly from github. First,
install the Node.JS LTS version for your system, then run the following in a
command shell;
```
npx https://github.com/satori99/at-demo.git -p 8000 -e development
```

This will start a local development server, that can be accessed in a browser
at http://localhost:8000
